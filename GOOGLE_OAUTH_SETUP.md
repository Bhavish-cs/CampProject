## Google OAuth Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your MERN stack project now has Google OAuth authentication integrated. Here's what was added:

### New Features:
1. **Google OAuth Login**: Users can now login with their Google accounts
2. **Existing Email/OTP Login**: Your original login system is still intact
3. **Unified User Management**: Google users and email users share the same user database

### Files Added/Modified:
- `config/passport.js` - Passport.js configuration for Google OAuth
- `models/user.js` - Added `googleId` field for linking Google accounts
- `routes/auth.js` - Added Google OAuth routes (`/auth/google` and `/auth/google/callback`)
- `views/auth/login.ejs` - Added "Continue with Google" button
- `views/layouts/boilerplate.ejs` - Added Font Awesome for icons

### How to Complete the Setup:

1. **Update Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"  
   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (from your Google Cloud project)
   - Add these URIs:
     - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: `http://localhost:3000`
     - **Authorized redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`

2. **Test the Integration**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/login
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Authorize your application
   - You'll be redirected back and logged in!

### Features:
- **Account Linking**: If a user with the same email exists, Google account gets linked
- **Auto-Verification**: Google users are automatically verified
- **Session Management**: Both login methods use the same session system
- **Flash Messages**: Success/error messages for both login methods

### Security Notes:
- Sessions are properly managed
- Users are serialized/deserialized correctly
- OTP system still works for non-Google users
- All routes are protected with authentication middleware

Your Google OAuth integration is ready to use! ðŸš€
